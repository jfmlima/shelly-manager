### Installation

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Create environment file:

```bash
cp env.example .env.local
```

3. Configure your API endpoint in `.env.local`:

```env
VITE_BASE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## 📝 Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

### Build Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t shelly-manager-web --build-arg VITE_BASE_API_URL=http://your-api-url:8000 .
```

### Run Container

```bash
docker run -p 3000:80 shelly-manager-web
```

### Docker Compose

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  web:
    build:
      context: .
      args:
        VITE_BASE_API_URL: http://api:8000
    ports:
      - "3000:80"
    depends_on:
      - api
```

## 🎨 UI Components

The application uses shadcn/ui components for a consistent, accessible design:

- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Tables**: Feature-rich data tables with sorting, filtering, and pagination
- **Dialogs**: Modal dialogs for confirmations and bulk operations
- **Theme**: System/light/dark mode with smooth transitions
- **Toast**: Beautiful notifications for user feedback

## 📡 API Integration

The web interface communicates with the Shelly Manager API for:

- Device discovery and scanning
- Device status monitoring
- Firmware updates
- Device configuration
- Bulk operations

All API calls are managed through TanStack Query for optimal caching and error handling.

## 🌐 Internationalization

The application supports internationalization using react-i18next:

- All user-facing strings are externalized
- Easy to add new languages
- Currently supports English (en)

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `VITE_BASE_API_URL`: Base URL of the Shelly Manager API (required)

### Local Storage Settings

User preferences are stored in localStorage:

- Theme preference
- Table pagination settings
- Column visibility preferences

## 📱 Responsive Design

The interface is fully responsive and optimized for:

- **Desktop**: Full-featured interface with multi-column layouts
- **Tablet**: Optimized spacing and touch-friendly controls
- **Mobile**: Compact navigation and single-column layouts

## 🔒 Security

- CSP headers configured in nginx
- XSS protection
- No sensitive data stored in localStorage
- Environment-based API configuration
- **Credential Management**: Device passwords stored encrypted on backend
  - Requires `SHELLY_SECRET_KEY` environment variable on API server
  - Passwords never exposed in UI or API responses
  - Credentials Manager UI for adding/removing device passwords
- **Backup Snapshots**: Device configuration backups are encrypted with the same `SHELLY_SECRET_KEY` and stored server-side
